## Overview

I am going to be creating my own API and carrying it over to my React App for use so that you get weather information as well as a map.

Create my files, set my requires, create my app.gets, set my port, create a class with information, bring it over to my React App and put it to use.

## Architecture

Cors, dotenv, express, javascript, react, axios, css
